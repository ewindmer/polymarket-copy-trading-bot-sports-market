### Trading Strategies

* **Buy Strategy**: When target wallet buys, calculate position size based on balance ratio
* **Sell Strategy**: When target wallet sells, match the sell proportionally
* **Merge Strategy**: When target wallet closes position but you still hold, sell your position
* **Error Handling**: Retry failed orders up to RETRY_LIMIT, then mark as failed
